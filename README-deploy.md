# DISENFUTURED Website Setup

## Live Setup Instructions

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run locally
This is primarily a static website — you can serve it with any static server. For a simple local test, open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server such as `live-server` or `http-server`.

## Deployment

Deploy the static files to your platform of choice (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.). No AI keys or backend chat endpoint are required after removing the AI/chat wrapper.

## Features

- Authentic Windows 98 Interface: Complete with taskbar, start menu, and draggable windows
- Band Information Hub: Everything about DISENFUTURED

## Customization

Edit the site files (`index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`) to update band info, links, and visuals.
